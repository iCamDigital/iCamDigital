## Server Setup

To deploy Framecast AI to production on any sort of custom server, we're going to go through some of the steps to
setup the server accordingly. First up, we have to setup Nginx. Let's start.

```json filename="Terminal" copy
cd "source code"
```

## Nginx Setup

To ensure proper setup, follow the steps given below:

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Steps>

### Connect to your VPS through `SSH`

In your terminal, enter the following command to connect to your VPS through `SSH`:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

### Install Nginx

Install Nginx using your terminal, this may take a moment:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo apt install nginx
```

Now we need to adjust our Firewall. we can see the Firewall app list by using this command:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo ufw app list
```

You should get a list of the applications like this:

```json filename="Output"
Available applications:
Nginx Full
Nginx HTTP
Nginx HTTPS
OpenSSH
```

We only need to allow traffic on port 80 and port 443. You can do this by typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo ufw allow "Nginx HTTP"
sudo ufw allow "Nginx HTTPS"
```

Next up, we can enable our Firewall by typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo ufw enable
```

Let's check the status of our Firewall:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo ufw status
```

An output like this will be visible to you:

```json filename="Output" copy
Status: active
To Action From
 - - - - - -
OpenSSH ALLOW Anywhere
Nginx HTTP ALLOW Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6)
Nginx HTTP (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6)
```

Now let’s check with the systemd init system to make sure the service is running by typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
systemctl status nginx
```

Our service has started successfully, we can test it by requesting a page from Nginx. We can visit the Nginx
default landing page by entering your VPS IP address into your browser’s address bar:

```json filename="Browser" copy
http://your_vps_ip_address
```

If you don’t know your IP address you can find it by using ipinfo.io by typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
curl ipinfo.io
```

An output like this will be visible afterwards:

```json filename="Output"
{
  "ip": "your_VPS_ip_addrs",
  "city": "#########",
  "region": "#######",
  "country": "##",
  "loc": "######,####",
  "org": "#######",
  "postal": "####",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/"
}
```

### Configure Nginx As A Reverse Proxy

Start by creating a new Nginx configuration file for Framecast AI:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nextjs.conf
```

Paste the following configuration, replacing `your_domain_name` with your domain name:

```json filename="Nginx" copy
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_name www.your_domain_name;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Save and close the file. you can save the file by clicking `ctrl+o`. Now let’s remove the default conf file by
typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Lastly, restart Nginx:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Installing NodeJS On Our Server

We can install NodeJS by typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | sudo gpg - dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
NODE_MAJOR=20
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_$NODE_MAJOR.x nodistro main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
```

We can check if we have properly installed Nodejs by typing:

```json filename="Terminal" copy
node
```

If you have installed NodeJS properly, you will see the NodeJS output like below:

```json filename="Output"
Welcome to Node.js v21.1.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
>
```

### Installing Docker And Docker Compose

Before proceeding with the server setup, install Docker and Docker Compose, Type them one by one:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.23.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Start and enable Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Verify installations
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

</Steps>

This completes our initial setup of the server. Next up, we will be setting up the environment variables.
